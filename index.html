            <h3>Lionel Messi</h3>
            <p>
              La Pulga Atómica (the Atomic Flea) has remained at the top of this list for over a decade now, and at 33,
              he’s still going strong. In fact, sensational stats and seasons have become second nature for him.

            <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
            <p>
              As long as he’s around, he’ll be up near the top of the list. Cristiano Ronaldo is 35 years old, playing
              in Italy for only his second year, and still racking up absurd numbers in front of goal.

            <h3>Neymar</h3>
            <p>
              Despite struggling with injury this season as well as not having played since early March due to Ligue
              1’s decision to end the season early rather than restart play after lockdown, Neymar Jr. comes in third
              on my list.

            <h3>Robert Lewandowski</h3>
            <p>
              Bayern Munich’s world-class frontman just finished his sixth season with the club and his tenth season in
              the Bundesliga altogether, helping Bayern win its 8th title in a row. And at 31, Robert Lewandowski had
              his best season yet.

          <div>
            <h3>Kylian Mbappé</h3>
            <p>
              Mbappé only falls short of Lewandowski on my list due to his youth and the fact that he hasn’t played
              since March. However, in a few years, the French 21-year-old could very well be at the top of this list,
              for his stats and ability...

            <h3>Kevin De Bruyne</h3>
            <p>
              Another player who could easily end up challenging for the Ballon d’Or at the end of the year is
              Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne. The Belgian midfielder is absolutely world-class.

            <h3>Virgil van Dijk</h3>
            <p>
              The Dutch defender signed for Liverpool from Southampton in January of 2018 and has since become one of
              the best Premier League defenders of all time. One of the most important players in an excellent

            <h3>Sadio Mané</h3>
            <p>
              Besides the team’s defensive strength, Liverpool has had one of the most threatening attacks in the world
              in the past few years, and Sadio Mané has been a key reason why.

          <div>
            <h3>Riyad Mahrez</h3>
            <p>
              Similar to Liverpool, it is incredibly difficult to pick out one attacking player in a side with so much
              talent up front and on the wings. What makes this even more difficult is that Manchester City’s squad
              depth forces some of the team’s best...

          Argentina and, importantly, Lionel Messi finally got his hands on an
          international trophy as they defeated arch-rivals Brazil to win
          their first international title since 1993 and a record fifteenth
